<!--
    Not all sections are relevant for all projects. It's up to the team to decide what sections makes most sense. Objective of the readme is to serve as a technical introduction to faciliate onboarding for technical ppl (developers).
    License and contributions are detailed in their own files, no need to add too many details in the Readme.
    If the project has technical documentation stored in another location (such as a website), effort should be made not to duplicate content (since it will become outdated at some point). In that case, keep the readme instructions very brief (such as a set of CLI commands).
